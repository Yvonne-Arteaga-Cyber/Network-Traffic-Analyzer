# Network Traffic Analyzer

This Python-based project uses Wireshark and Python scripts to analyze and detect anomalies in network traffic. It was developed as part of a university project focused on cybersecurity and network analysis.

## Features
- Packet inspection and filtering using Wireshark
- Python script to scan logs and detect security anomalies
- Output summaries of detected issues for easy review

## Technologies Used
- Wireshark
- Python (file I/O, parsing, basic conditionals)
- PCAP files
- Text-based log interpretation

## How to Run
1. Capture or load a `.pcap` file using Wireshark.
2. Run the Python script to parse logs or exported text.
3. View results for any detected anomalies.

## What I Learned
- How to use Wireshark to capture and analyze packets
- How to use Python to extract, filter, and flag suspicious activity
- How to automate part of the network analysis process

## Status
Completed â€“ Uploaded to GitHub to showcase my hands-on experience in network monitoring and analysis.
